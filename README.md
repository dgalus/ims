# IMS - Icecast Metadata Sender

  

Simple service for sending metadata to icecast server. IMS opens UDP socket, similarly to Opticodec-PC Streaming Encoder ([see more here](ftp://ftp.orban.com/1511/Opticodec_1010_Encoder/Documentation/PAD_Metadata/1010.3.7_PAD.pdf)) and sends *artist* and *title* of song to Icecast.
